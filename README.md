# Problem Statemnet:
Despite the rising technology start-up revolution across India, the livelihoods of a majority of the country's population are dependent on agriculture. In 2018, over 50,000 farmers from across the nation walked hundreds of kilometres to highlight their woes, and how poor product prices and lack of direct market linkages have negatively impacted the incomes of agricultural communities.
Farmers in India do not get a fair share of their hard-work. They do not have a secure mode for the payment of their hard work.
